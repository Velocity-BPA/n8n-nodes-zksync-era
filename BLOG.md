# Automate zkSync Era Blockchain Operations with Our New n8n Community Node

We're excited to announce the release of n8n-nodes-zksync-era, a powerful new community node that brings zkSync Era blockchain integration directly into your n8n workflows!

## The Challenge

As Layer 2 scaling solutions gain traction, zkSync Era has emerged as a leading platform for fast, low-cost Ethereum transactions. However, integrating blockchain operations into business automation workflows has traditionally required significant development effort, custom scripts, and ongoing maintenance. Teams need a way to interact with zkSync Era that's both powerful and accessible to non-developers.

## Introducing n8n-nodes-zksync-era

Velocity BPA has developed this community node to bridge the gap between zkSync Era's blockchain capabilities and n8n's intuitive automation platform. Now you can incorporate blockchain operations into your workflows as easily as connecting to any other API or service.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Connect to zkSync Era networks directly from your n8n workflows
- **No-Code Interface**: Execute blockchain operations without writing Solidity or complex scripts
- **Flexible Operations**: Support for common zkSync Era interactions including transactions, balance checks, and smart contract calls
- **Production-Ready**: Built with reliability and security best practices in mind
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent code available for review and contribution

## Use Cases

- Automate cryptocurrency payment processing
- Monitor wallet balances and trigger actions based on thresholds
- Integrate blockchain transactions with CRM, ERP, or other business systems
- Build custom DeFi automation workflows
- Create blockchain-powered notification systems

## Getting Started

Installation is simple. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-zksync-era


After restarting n8n, you'll find the zkSync Era node available in your node palette, ready to use in your workflows.
